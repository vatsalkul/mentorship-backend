[Mentorship System](https://github.com/systers/mentorship-backend) is an application that allows women in tech to mentor each other, on career development topics, through 1:1 relations for a certain period.
This is the Backend REST API for the Mentorship System.

## Setup and run

To setup the project locally read these wiki pages and follow the instructions:

 - [Fork, Clone and Remote](https://github.com/systers/mentorship-backend/wiki/Fork%2C-Clone-%26-Remote)
 - [Export Environment Variables](https://github.com/systers/mentorship-backend/wiki/Environment-Variables)

### Run app

The project runs on Python 3.

1. Create a virtual environment:
`virtualenv venv --python=python3`

2. Activate the virtual environment:
`source ./venv/bin/activate`

3. Install all the dependencies in `requirements.txt` file:
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

4. Make sure you create `.env` using `.env.template` and update the values of corresponding environment variables
or
make sure you exported the following [environment variables](https://github.com/systers/mentorship-backend/wiki/Environment-Variables):

```
export FLASK_ENVIRONMENT_CONFIG=<local-or-dev-or-test-or-prod-or-stag>
export SECRET_KEY=<your-secret-key>
export SECURITY_PASSWORD_SALT=<your-security-password-salt>
export MAIL_DEFAULT_SENDER=<mail-default-sender>
export MAIL_SERVER=<mail-server>
export APP_MAIL_USERNAME=<app-mail-username>
export APP_MAIL_PASSWORD=<app-mail-password>
```

If you're testing any environment other than "local", then you have to also set these other variables:
```
export DB_TYPE=<database_type>
export DB_USERNAME=<database_username>
export DB_PASSWORD=<database_password>
export DB_ENDPOINT=<database_endpoint>
export DB_NAME=<database_name>
```

**NOTE: If you are using Gmail id, then [Two Step authentication](https://support.outreach.io/hc/en-us/articles/206126307-Set-Up-Gmail-Two-Step-Authentication) must be turned on. After that, you need to generate an app password (Please read the 3rd step from this: [link](https://support.cloudways.com/configure-gmail-smtp/)). Copy the generated password and paste it here: `<app-mail-password>`.**


5. Run the app:
`python run.py`

6. Navigate to http://localhost:5000 in your browser 

7. When you are done using the app, deactivate the virtual environment:
`deactivate`

### Run the android app while hosting server locally 

1. Fork and clone [mentorship-android](https://github.com/anitab-org/mentorship-android).

2. Open the project in Android Studio.

3. Open Build Variants on the left side of Android Studio and select `debug_localhost` from the drop down list. [Image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30840527/75633088-0a54d380-5c28-11ea-996e-424c8fb4e951.png)

Know more about [emulator networking](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/emulator-networking)

After signing up using an android emulator you will get an email on registered email ID with a verification link. The link will look like this: http://10.0.2.2:5000/user/confirm_email/Imt1....

If you try to open this on any other device or on your laptop, the link will not work. The shortcut is to copy the link and paste it in the android emulator. 
You will be able to verify the email account.

Alternate method:
Copy the verification link and change http://10.0.2.2:5000/ to http://127.0.0.1:5000/ (127.0.0.1) is your local machine IP address on which the backend is hosted and now you can open the link on your local machineâ€™s browser.	


### Run with docker
1. Make sure you exported the following [environment variables](https://github.com/systers/mentorship-backend/wiki/Environment-Variables) to '.env' file

2. Build docker image
```
docker build -t mentorship-backend:latest .
```
3. Deploy
Docker container ports must be mapped to the host machine port using '--publish' so they're visible.
```sh
docker run --env "FLASK_APP=run.py" --publish 5000:5000 mentorship-backend:latest
```

### Run tests

To run the unitests run the following command in the terminal (while the virtual environment is activated):

`python -m unittest discover tests`
